### Introduction
As a part of the Data Science Nanodegree from Udacity, this project seeks to display an understanding and utlization of Natural Language Processing within a Machine Learning Pipeline. The context of the dataset is emergency messages (disaster related). The project consists of the data, data wrangling, model buildling and model packaging, and the web app.
